# flock
Flock aims to make it easy to build horizontally scalable systems on top of [raft](https://raft.github.io/).

### ptarmigan
Ptarmigan aims to be a horizontally scalable key-value store with an API similar to that of [etcd](https://etcd.io/) built on top of flock.

### Roadmap
I'm hoping to have an initial release ready some time by the end of 2020.
